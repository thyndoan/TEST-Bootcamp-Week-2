      <h3>Directions</h3>
      <p>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch
        square baking pan. Mix sugar, flour, cocoa powder, salt, and baking
        powder together in a mixing bowl. Whisk butter, eggs, and vanilla
        together in a separate bowl. Add butter mixture to the flour mixture and
        mix until well combined.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pour 1/2 of the batter into the prepared baking pan and smooth out with
        a spatula. Add 16 OREO® cookies in an even layer (4 rows of 4 cookies),
        then spread the remaining 1/2 of the batter over top.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bake in the preheated oven until edges are brown and center is set, 30
        to 35 minutes. Remove pan from the oven and set on a wire rack. Let
        brownies cool completely, at least 30 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Crush 12 of the remaining OREO® cookies. Place the whipped topping in a
        bowl and fold in the crushed cookies. Spread over the top of the
        brownies. Crush the remaining 4 cookies, then sprinkle over the top of
        the whipped cream mixture. Keep refrigerated until you are ready to
        slice and serve.
